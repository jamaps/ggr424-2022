	\section*{Travel Field Notes}
	
	Describe your personal impressions and experiences of a daily trip. This should be a regular/common trip that you currently do, or previously undertook regularly (e.g. your commute to school, to work, a trip to the grocery store, to the library, to visit family, etc.). First describe your trip including the mode(s) you used, the neighbourhoods you started and ended in, the main routes you travelled on (e.g. Highway 401, Bloor-Danforth Subway Line, etc.), and how long it took.
	% Then write about your feelings, perceptions, and observations taking various forms of transit, walking, cycling, and/or driving.
	Then evaluate aspects of this experience of urban transportation that 1) worked for you or were even enjoyable and 2) that were problematic, challenging, or stressful. For instance, in addition to travel times and congestion, you may want to think of issues like comfort, accessibility, equity, health, sustainability, and safety.	
	
	600 to 900 words + at least 2 photos relating to key locations in your description. The photos can either be taken by yourself or from online somewhere (please note your sources)

	
	\subsection*{Marking Guideline}
	
	The assignment will be marked out of \textbf{10}:
	
	\textbf{3} marks for quality of writing (spelling, grammar, style, readability, staying within word limit)
	
	\textbf{5.5} marks for content (describing your trip and evaluating it in terms of what is described above)
	
	\textbf{1.5} marks for including at least 2 photos (each photo should directly relate to your text and each should have a short descriptive caption)
	
	\textit{Due on Quercus as a PDF or Word doc}
