	\section*{Transit Station Critique}
	
	Describe and critique a public transit station that you use (or have used) frequently. 
	
	The station can be any TTC or GO Station in the Toronto area (excluding Union Station), or any transit station in another city.
	
	Please include the following in your submission:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Describe the transit routes that connect to it and the common modes of transport that people use to access	the station.
		\item Critique the station in its effectiveness in providing connections between routes and between modes, and in terms of its public space and amenities. What parts of the station work well? Which do not? (e.g. this can include discussion on signage and wayfinding,	benches and seating, cleanliness, crowding, accessibility considerations, other amenities, etc.).
		\item Briefly describe the land use around the station and argue whether its surrounding area is a good example of Transit Oriented Development (TOD).
		\item Include at least 1 labelled map of the station and surrounding area that you can make reference to in your text. The map can either be from an external source (e.g. from a transit agencies website or a marked up Google Maps screenshot) or be one you create yourself using GIS or other software.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	700 to 1000 words in total (not including any maps or figures)
