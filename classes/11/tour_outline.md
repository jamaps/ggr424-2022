Hi everyone,

For class on Monday (Mar 21), I thought we would take our class outside and do a "transportation" walking tour of campus. The aim being to have some discussions of what we've talked about in-class, but applied towards the transportation-related built environment in and around campus.

Let's meet outside Sid Smith (Huron side) at 1:20pm, and we'll plan to depart at 1:30pm.  The weather is supposed to be clear, but a little chilly (8 degrees). If you have any bags that you don't want to carry with you, we can keep them in my locked office in SS5060. If you want to store your bag here, come by between 1:00pm and 1:15pm.

We'll probably finish before 3pm. And I'll stick around afterwards if anyone has questions about the final project.

- Jeff
