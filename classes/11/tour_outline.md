Hi everyone,

For class on Monday (Mar 21), I thought we would take our class outside and do a "transportation" walking tour of campus. The aim being to have some discussions of what we've talked about in class, but applied towards the transportation-related built environment in and around campus.

Let's meet outside Sid Smith on the West side (Huron side) by the doors at 1:20pm, and we'll plan to depart at 1:30pm.  The weather is supposed to be clear, but a little chilly (8 degrees). If you have any bags that you don't want to carry with you, we can keep them in my locked office. If you want to store your bag, come by between 1:00pm and 1:15pm.

We'll probably finish around 2:30pm. And I'll stick around afterwards if anyone has questions about the final project.

Of course if you can't attend for any reason (e.g. feeling ill or otherwise), please just let me know by email, and I won't take off any participation marks.

\- Jeff
