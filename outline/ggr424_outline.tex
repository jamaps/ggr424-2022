	\section*{Course Description}
	
	% copied from posting
	Introductory overview of major issues in interurban and intraurban transportation at the local, national and international scale. Topics include urban transportation, land use patterns and the environment, causes of and cures for congestion, public transit, infrastructure finance, and transport planning and policy setting. 
	
	
	\section*{Learning Outcomes}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Understand fundamental concepts and theories in urban transportation geography and planning.
		
		\item Identify and critically assess major social, political, economic, and environmental issues related to urban transportation.
		
		\item Analyze and visualize transportation-related data (including using GIS) to describe travel behaviour, transportation networks, land use, and accessibility.
		
		\item Apply the theoretical and practical knowledge you have acquired from the course to develop recommendations on improving urban transport systems.

%	\section*{Course Objectives}
		
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Discuss the implications of the availability and suitability of crowdsourced geographic data for solving particular types of problems
%		\item Describe and critically evaluate potential problems and biases with data created by crowdsourced geographic projects.
%		\item Evaluate and describe potential implications (e.g., privacy, surveillance) caused by some of the technologies and socio-economic practices that support crowdsourcing.
%		\item Be able to contribute to OpenStreetMap as well as download OpenStreetMap data.
%		\item Learn how to create a simple crowdsourcing web application.

	\section*{Required Materials}
	
	There is no textbook for this course. All readings will be posted on Quercus.
	

	
	\section*{Lateness \& Submissions Policy}
	
	All assignments should be submitted via the course website. Except in the case of personal or medical emergencies, work must be submitted on time. Extensions may be permitted on a case-by-case basis through consultation with the instructor. Late assignments will be docked 10\% per day, including weekends. Re-weighting of assignments/grades is not permitted.
	
	
	
	
		
	

	\section*{Projects \& Evaluation}
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Travel Field Notes (20\%)}
	
	Your personal impressions of various modes of transportation as you experience them. Using auto-ethnography and thick description, you will write about your feelings, perceptions, and observations taking various forms of transit, walking, cycling, and/or driving. Evaluate aspects of urban transportation that 1) work for you and 2) that you find challenging. For instance, in addition to travel times and congestion, you may want to think of issues like comfort, accessibility, equity, health, sustainability, and safety.	5 pages single spaced.
	
	\textit{Due February 7}
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Transportation Data Analysis (30\%)}
	
	This assignment will consist of an analysis and interpretation of data from the Canadian census, the Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS), and various transportation datasets in GIS. Your assignment will be to query and map these data and answer a set of analytical questions. The final report will be approximately 5-7 pages and will include charts, graphs, and maps along with textual interpretation.
	
	\textit{Due February 28}
	
	\subsubsection*{Transportation Improvement Plan (Report 25\%, Presentation 10\%)}
	
	You will propose an intervention, solution, or
	improvement to a transportation problem you have identified in either youru previous assignments or another project of your choosing. This plan or proposal can vary by mode, geography, and objectives. You will be evaluated on how evidence-based and well-reasoned it is as well as how effectively it is communicated. Big and small ideas welcomed, as well as imaginative ones that address particular problems that exist in the transportation landscape (e.g. improvement for a particular street or transit line) or broader issues such as transportation equity, sustainability, potential mode shift, and efficiency. You should demonstrate how your plan achieves some aspect of the public good. The plan should be 7-10	pages. Feel free to consider using a variety of communication methods for your plan, including design sketches, maps, street plans, renderings, and/or photographs.
	
	The final two classes will be devoted to short (5 min) presentations followed by a brief Q\&A period. The report will be due after the last class, so the presentation does not need to consist of a "complete" project.
	
	
	
	\subsubsection*{In-Class Participation, Exercises, \& Quizzes (15\%)}
	
	The quality of your learning experience depends as much on your participation as well as what the instructor brings. There will be several interactive aspects to the class, including group discussions and design exercises. Attendance will be noted during class. Each of the first 11 weeks will involve at least one in-class activity, group discussion, or quiz. Each class will be worth 1.5\% (you thus have the opportunity to earn a maximum of 16.5\%).
	
	
	
	
	
	\section*{Academic Integrity}
	
	Academic integrity is essential to the pursuit of learning and scholarship in a university, and to ensuring that a degree from the University of Toronto is a strong signal of each student’s individual academic achievement. As a result, the University treats cases of cheating and plagiarism very seriously. The University of Toronto's Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters outlines the behaviours that constitute academic dishonesty and the processes for addressing academic offences. 
	
	For papers and assignments, this includes using someone else's ideas or words without appropriate acknowledgement, submitting your own work in more than one course without the permission of the instructor in all relevant courses,	making up sources or facts, or obtaining or providing unauthorized assistance on any assignment.
	
	All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following procedures outlined in the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. If you have questions or concerns about what constitutes appropriate academic behaviour or appropriate research and citation methods, please reach out to me. For further information on academic integrity, please see \url{http://academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/}.
	
	
	\section*{Mental Health \& Accessibility}
	
	The University provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities in accordance with the terms of the Ontario Human Rights Code. This occurs through a collaborative process that acknowledges a collective obligation to develop an accessible learning environment that both meets the needs of students and preserves the essential academic requirements of the University's courses and programs. Please see \href{https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/department/accessibility-services/}{Accessibility Services} for more information.
	
	As a student at U of T, you may experience circumstances and challenges that can affect your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate fully in daily activities. An important part of the University experience is learning how and when to ask for help. There is no wrong time to reach out, which is why there are resources available for every situation and every level of stress. Here are some available resources:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		
		\item \href{https://safety.utoronto.ca/}{Student Life Safety \& Support}
		\item \href{https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/department/health-wellness/}{Student Life Health \& Wellness}
		\item \href{https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/task/support-when-you-feel-distressed/}{Emergency support if you’re feeling distressed}
		
		\item \href{https://mentalhealth.utoronto.ca/}{Student Mental Health Resources}
		
		\item  \href{https://geography.utoronto.ca/department/mental-health-resources/}{Additional mental health resources can also be found on the Geography website}
	\end{itemize}

	
	\section*{Writing}
	
	Clear writing and communicating is essential. You will be expected to write clearly and effectively on
	assignments. The University provides some resources through the writing centres. Brief advice on
	specific elements of writing for university courses can also be found here:
