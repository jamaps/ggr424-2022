	\section*{\textsf{Meeting Details}}
	
	Class will meet synchronously from 1:00pm-3:00pm on Mondays. For (at least) the first three weeks, class will meet online via zoom (links will be posted on the course website). Depending on U of T's COVID-19 policy, class may then shift to in-person in SS 2111

	
	
	\section*{Required Materials}
	
	There is no textbook for this course. All readings will be posted on Quercus. See the course schedule (below) for a list of readings.
	
	
	\section*{Course Communication}
	
	Please use email with discretion and mostly for personal matters that should not be shared with other members of the course (e.g., seeking an extension). 
	
	Please put â€œGGR424" in your subject line when emailing me so I can flag it. I will do my best to reply within 24 hours (not including weekends).
	
	For questions about course content, please save them for class when the answer can benefit other students. 
	
		
	\section*{Lateness \& Submissions Policy}
	
	All assignments must be submitted via Quercus. Except in the case of personal or medical emergencies, work must be submitted on time. Extensions may be permitted on a case-by-case basis through consultation with the instructor prior to the deadline. Late assignments will be docked 10\% per day, including weekends. Re-weighting of assignments/grades is not permitted.
	
	
	
	
		
	

	\section*{Projects \& Evaluation}
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Travel Field Notes (10\%)}
	
	Describe your personal impressions and experiences of a daily trip. This should be a regular/common trip that you currently do, or previously undertook regularly (e.g. your commute to school, to work, a trip to the grocery store, to the library, to visit family, etc.). First describe your trip including the mode(s) you used, the neighbourhoods you started and ended in, the main routes you travelled on (e.g. Highway 401, Bloor-Danforth Subway Line, etc.), and how long it took.
	% Then write about your feelings, perceptions, and observations taking various forms of transit, walking, cycling, and/or driving.
	Then evaluate aspects of this experience of urban transportation that 1) worked for you or were even enjoyable and 2) that were problematic, challenging, or stressful. For instance, in addition to travel times and congestion, you may want to think of issues like comfort, accessibility, equity, health, sustainability, and safety.	
	
	600 to 900 words + at least 2 photos relating to key locations in your description.
	
	\textit{Due January 24}
	
	
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Transit Station Critique (10\%)}
	
	Describe and critique a public transit station that you use (or have used) frequently. First, describe the transit routes that connect to it and the common modes of transport that people use to access the station. Second, critique the station in it's effectiveness in providing connections between routes and between modes, and in terms of it's public space and amenities. What parts of the station work well? Which do not? (e.g. this can include discussion on signage and wayfinding, benches and seating, cleanliness, crowding, accessibility considerations, other amenities, etc.). And third, briefly describe the land use around the station and argue whether its surrounding area is a good example of Transit Oriented Development (TOD). 
	
	600 to 900 words + at least 1 map of the station and surrounding area
	
	\textit{Due February 7}
	
	
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Transportation Data Analysis (30\%)}
	
	This assignment will consist of an analysis and interpretation of data from the Canadian census, the Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS), and various transportation datasets in GIS. Your assignment will be to query and map these data and answer a set of analytical questions. The final report will be approximately 5 to 7 pages and will include charts, graphs, and maps along with textual interpretation. Details about this assignment will be posted on the course website.
	
	\textit{Due February 28}
	
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Transportation Improvement Plan (Proposal 5\%, Report 25\%, Presentation 5\%)}
	
	You will propose an intervention, solution, or
	improvement to a transportation problem you have identified in either your previous assignments or another project of your choosing. This plan or proposal can vary by mode, geography, and objectives. You will be evaluated on how evidence-based and well-reasoned it is as well as how effectively it is communicated. Big and small ideas welcomed, as well as imaginative ones that address particular problems that exist in the transportation landscape (e.g. improvement for a particular street or transit line) or broader issues such as transportation equity, sustainability, potential mode shift, and efficiency. The plan should be approximately 5 to 7 pages. Feel free to consider using a variety of communication methods for your plan, including design sketches, maps, street plans, renderings, and/or photographs.
	
	The final two classes will be devoted to short (5 min) presentations followed by a brief Q\&A period. The report will be due after the last class, so the presentation does not need to consist of a "complete" project.
	
	Further details will be posted on the course website.
	
	
	\subsubsection*{In-Class Participation, Exercises, \& Quizzes (15\%)}
	
	The quality of your learning experience depends as much on your participation as well as what the instructor brings. There will be several interactive aspects to the class, including group discussions and design exercises. Attendance will be noted during class. Each of the first 11 weeks will involve at least one in-class activity, group discussion, or quiz. Each class will be worth 1.5\% (you thus have the opportunity to earn a maximum of 16.5\%).
	
	
	
	
	
	\section*{Academic Integrity}
	
	Academic integrity is essential to the pursuit of learning and scholarship in a university, and to ensuring that a degree from the University of Toronto is a strong signal of each studentâ€™s individual academic achievement. As a result, the University treats cases of cheating and plagiarism very seriously. The University of Toronto's Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters outlines the behaviours that constitute academic dishonesty and the processes for addressing academic offences. 
	
	For papers and assignments, this includes using someone else's ideas or words without appropriate acknowledgement, submitting your own work in more than one course without the permission of the instructor in all relevant courses,	making up sources or facts, or obtaining or providing unauthorized assistance on any assignment.
	
	All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following procedures outlined in the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. If you have questions or concerns about what constitutes appropriate academic behaviour or appropriate research and citation methods, please reach out to me. For further information on academic integrity, please see \url{http://academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/}.
	
	
	\section*{Mental Health \& Accessibility}
	
	The University provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities in accordance with the terms of the Ontario Human Rights Code. This occurs through a collaborative process that acknowledges a collective obligation to develop an accessible learning environment that both meets the needs of students and preserves the essential academic requirements of the University's courses and programs. Please see \href{https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/department/accessibility-services/}{Accessibility Services} for more information.
	
	As a student at U of T, you may experience circumstances and challenges that can affect your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate fully in daily activities. An important part of the University experience is learning how and when to ask for help. There is no wrong time to reach out, which is why there are resources available for every situation and every level of stress. Here are some available resources:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		
		\item \href{https://safety.utoronto.ca/}{Student Life Safety \& Support}
		\item \href{https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/department/health-wellness/}{Student Life Health \& Wellness}
		\item \href{https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/task/support-when-you-feel-distressed/}{Emergency support if youâ€™re feeling distressed}
		
		\item \href{https://mentalhealth.utoronto.ca/}{Student Mental Health Resources}
		
		\item  \href{https://geography.utoronto.ca/department/mental-health-resources/}{Additional mental health resources can also be found on the Geography website}
	\end{itemize}

	
	\section*{Writing}
	
	Clear writing and communicating is essential. You will be expected to write clearly and effectively on
	assignments. The University provides some resources through the writing centres. Brief advice on
	specific elements of writing for university courses can also be found here:	
	\url{https://writing.utoronto.ca/writing-centres/arts-and-science/}
	



	
	\section*{Course Schedule}
	
	The following outlines course topics and material on a week-to-week basis. For each week, there will be 1 or 2  readings (either accessible from a URL posted on the course website). For most weeks, I've also included links to other media (e.g. short videos, maps, interactive websites) that I encourage you to check out, as they will greatly enhance your learning experience throughout the course.
